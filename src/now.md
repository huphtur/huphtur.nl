Living in Portland, Oregon, with my lovely wife, [Kayo](https://www.instagram.com/catfish13/) and our two cats. Doing some interesting work with the folks at [Network Ninja](https://networkninja.com/). 

Since it’s winter here, I’ve been riding my bike indoors on the [TrainingPeaks Virtual](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/virtual/) platform. I’m also trying to play golf, but it gets tricky sometimes with frozen grounds.
