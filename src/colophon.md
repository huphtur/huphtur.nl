I mostly use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Pixelmator Pro](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/) on a [MacBook Air](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/) to create content for my blog. 

The [source code](https://github.com/huphtur/huphtur.nl) is uploaded to GitHub, which automatically deploys the site on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) as the static site generator.
