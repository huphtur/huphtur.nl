Every true cyclist knows the race season doesn't start until Omloop ~~Het Volk~~ Nieuwsblad. Yes, there are some early season things happening _down under_ and in other desert like environments, but none of those really count until _openingsweekend_. 

In anticipation of Omloop I created one of them [single-serving sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-serving_site) that does one thing: [how many days until Omloop](https://howmanydaysuntilomloop.com/). That's it, that's the site.

The site is just some hacked together JavaScript, and am sure someone smarter will be able to produce a more elegant solution. I sprinkled in some minimal CSS styling and actually kinda pumped to finally have an excuse for using the Impact typeface.

You can view the source on the site or on GitHub in a repo named "[ompoop](https://github.com/huphtur/ompoop)" (a nod to a cycling Twitter meme from back in the day). 

I believe there used to be a How Many Days Until Omloop Twitter bot, that would tweet daily, but that was shut down long time ago, way before Space Karen turned Twitter into a shithole.

Interestingly, when you visit the [official Omloop Nieuwsblad site](https://www.omloophetnieuwsblad.be/en), their race counter seems to be off by a day ðŸ¤·
