Right after we moved into [our new house](https://www.instagram.com/p/B4DR4uCFLMR/), I took a photo with my iPhone every morning at 8 am. So, 300+ photos later, here's a timelapse in ~13 seconds:

The sound is the final track of The KLF's _Chill Out_ album but reversed (thanks [AudioMass](https://audiomass.co/)) for extra dramatic effect. 

## Highlights

December 3. The first photo I shot. Freezing cold morning with frost on the roofs.

March 11. The neighbor's maple tree is now in full bloom, temperatures have risen a bit. Spring is here!

March 14. What spring? It's snowing! Crazy to see the foliage bend under the weight of the snow. A week later we will bend under the pressure of COVID-19 and enter lock-down.

July 1. SQUIRREL! Gotta [zoom in](/images/timelapse-squirrel-zoom.jpg) a bit to spot it, but it's sitting on top of the roof.

September 12. The entire west coast of America is on fire. Crazy thick smoke, and even though our house is well insulated, we still have some smoke seep in.

November 25. Pretty much the end of the year, a seagull flying away... 

## Lowlights

* iPhone was not always aligned straight, so images jump around. Messed around in Affinity Photo for a couple of hours to get them aligned somewhat better. Wish I had used a tripod instead.
* Forgot about daylight savings nonsense. Kept shooting at 8 am, so shadows jump around.
* There are gaps in the sequence. Traveling (pre-pandemic), and when I forgot to take photos because life got busy. Oh, and that one time when I almost died from eating too much licorice (more on that in a future blog post).
