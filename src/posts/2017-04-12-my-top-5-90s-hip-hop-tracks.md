My friend [Matt Bochneak](https://twitter.com/MattBochneak) sent me a link to [Hauschka‚Äôs Top 5 ‚Äô90s Hip-Hop Tracks](http://www.self-titledmag.com/2017/04/05/hauschka-top-5-90s-hip-hop-tracks/). He thought the picks weren't that great. I replied that it's actually pretty hard to make picks because that era is so good. Which got me thinking, could I pick 5 tracks?

Here's the list of artists I looked at (pretty sure I still forgot a bunch):
2Pac,
A Tribe Called Quest,
Arrested Development,
Beastie Boys,
Big L,
Big Pun,
Black Sheep,
Black Star,
Bone Thugs-n-Harmony,
Busta Rhymes,
Casual,
Cypress Hill,
DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince,
DMX,
Dead Prez,
Del the Funky Homosapien,
Digable Planets,
Dr. Dre,
Eminem,
Eric B. & Rakim,
Fugees,
GZA,
Gang Starr,
House Of Pain,
Ice Cube,
Jay-Z,
Jeru The Damaja,
KRS-One,

Mobb Deep,
Mos Def,
N.W.A.,
Nas,
Naughty By Nature,

Pharoahe Monch,
Public Enemy,
Redman,
Scarface,
Sir Mix-A-Lot,
Snoop Dogg,
Souls of Mischief,
The Notorious B.I.G.,
The Pharcyde,
and Wu-Tang Clan.

After a week of internal debating, I was able to narrow it down to 5, but I failed in ranking them üò•. Here are my picks, sorted by release date‚Ä¶

## Eric B. & Rakim - Don't Sweat The Technique (1992)

Rakim, the greatest MC ever? _"Pencils and pens are swords / Letters put together from a key to chords."_. Eric B.'s beats on this track are amazing. The way the song starts with the bass line (sampled from Young-Holt Unlimited - [Queen Of The Nile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fcj1JHxq5fk)), followed by a saxophone (from Kool & the Gang - [Give It Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAcYoAyPdVM)), Rakim's voice and then that heavy bass drum üëç. The video clip is classic too, so many girls! DJ Cam Quartet did a great [jazz cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V24qn18dW1Q) of the song.

## The Pharcyde - Passin' Me By (1992)

I could leave it at [Summer in the City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xN3KOY2kbg), but did you know about there's all kinds of behind-the-scenes drama related to this song? According to most resources, J-Swift (originally from Spain) produced _Passin' Me By_. But, Imani and Bootie Brown (two members from The Pharcyde) claim that J-Swift [did not](http://revive-music.com/2012/06/11/imani-bootie-brown-are-the-pharcyde-celebrities-on-the-brink-of-insanity-part-1/#.V5FryLgrK00) produce _Passin' Me By_. After the release of the album, J-Swift gained some success (even did some remixes for Prince and Massive Attack) but  fell into depression and a gnarly drug addiction. In 2007, a documentary movie, _[1 More Hit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUCAhmsap_w)_, was made about his path to sobriety. In 2015, J-Swift relapsed, got caught with some substances and got deported to Spain. He recently [made a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MghX_KCmnUY) directed at (then) president Obama in hopes of returning home to his family in the US.

## Jeru The Damaja - Come Clean (1993)

DJ Premiere made the beat specifically for Jeru. That wood block sound (Shelly Manne - [Infinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fox8MliHOeA)) is what drew me in to this track. I guess it symbolizes: "Chinese water torture". Works for me! Complex did a great [mini-doc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHyQ14zEZls) about the making of this song. And how sick is that opening line? _"You wanna front, what, jump up and get bucked"_

## GZA - Cold World (1995)

The darkest and most sinister track of the _Liquid Swords_ album. Unfortunately not shown in the official video, but on the album the song start with a sample from the movie, [Shogun Assasin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogun_Assassin). _"I had a bad dream. Don't be afraid, bad dreams are only dreams. What a time you chose to be born."_

## Fugees - Ready or Not (1996)

Let's not kid ourselves, _The Score_, is filled with bangers. This track did not do so well in the US, but in Europe it did. I think it's because it contained an [Enya sample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKQwgpaLR6o). Yankees seem to not dig Enya as much as we Euros do, so therefor I pick _Ready or Not_ as my favorite Fugees track. Vibe reported that the video started the era of big budget, movie-like hip hop videos. The video features üöÅ ü¶à üöó üî´ üèç üí•, and cost $1.3 million to produce. In justifying the price tag, Pras [told Vibe](https://books.google.com/books?id=CywEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA28&dq=fugees+ready+or+not+video+cost#v=onepage&q=fugees%20ready%20or%20not%20video%20cost&f=false) _"People want to see drama, man. You figure: A kid pays sixteen dollars for your CD. Let him see a good video."_
