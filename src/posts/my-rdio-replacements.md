Some of us must have done something bad last year, because Santa shut down [Rdio](http://rdio.com/) right before Xmas. It was one of the better music services with a clean design and amazing comunity with whom I discovered and shared so many great tunes with.

![rdio goodbye banner image.](/images/rdio-goodbye.png)

After Rdio shut down a lot of people went with the obvious choices: [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/), [Apple Music](http://www.apple.com/music/), [Deezer](http://www.deezer.com/), etc. I played around with them for a bit but non did it for me. So I decided to go with some other options.

**Note**: my listening habbit is probably a tad different than the average person. I [don't care](/i-have-never/) much for Top 40 music and tend to focus on "electronic" music. I mostly listen to music via my notebook speakers or headphones.

## Direct

- [BandCamp](https://bandcamp.com/). Pretty much every artist or label that I like has a page on this platform. You can often listen to full albums before they are even officially released. And their Weekly Show is absolutely killer!

- [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/). If one of my favorite artist or labels is not on Bandcamp, they are most likely to be found on SoundCloud. Both platforms will notify you when new releases are out.

## Podcasts

- [Bleep](https://bleep.com/stream/podcasts). Great independent online music store with a very diverse podcast.
- [XLR8R](https://www.xlr8r.com/podcasts/). Used to be an actual magazine, now purely a web platform with artist interviews, reviews and of course a podcast.
- [Solid Steel](http://solidsteel.net/). Started as a radio show in the late 80s! I remember getting copies of shows burned on CDs from friends.
- [Ninja Tune](https://ninjatune.net/ninjacast.xml). Record label that occasionaly puts out podcasts with artists interviews including a selection of new releases.
- [Boiler Room](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/boiler-room/id416373570). Live music shows which sometimes get turned into podcasts.
- [Stones Throw](https://www.stonesthrow.com/podcast/). Killer record label from LA.
- [Turntable Lab](http://www.turntablelab.com/pages/turntable-lab-radio). A record store for DJs.
- [Gilles Peterson](http://www.gillespetersonworldwide.com/category/podcasts/). This legendary radio DJ has some of the best guests on his show.
- [Low End Theory](http://www.lowendtheoryclub.com/podcast/). A club night named after one of Tribe's best albums gets my automatic podcast subscription!
- [Phonica Records](http://phonicaradio.blogspot.com/). Music shop out of London.
- [Resident Advisor](http://www.residentadvisor.net/podcast.aspx). This amount of content that this site has to offer is overwhelming, so I just focus on their podcast.

## Streams

- [dublab](http://dublab.com/). Mostly replays of past shows, but keep [their twitter account](https://twitter.com/dublab) in check for live shows announcements.
- [SomaFM](https://somafm.com/). The default for background tunes. The [cliqhop idm](http://somafm.com/cliqhop/) station is my favorite.
- [Eclectic 24](http://www.kcrw.com/music/shows/eclectic24). It's pretty much KCRW's [Morning Becomes Eclectic](http://www.kcrw.com/music/shows/morning-becomes-eclectic) (sans Jason Bentley) and it's really solid.
- [Red Light Radio](http://redlightradio.net/). A Dutch station that broadcasts (in English) from a tiny studio in the famous Red Light District in Amsterdam. [Parra](/wheres-the-fun-in-skateboarding/) occasionaly has a show on it.
- [East Village Radio](http://dashradio.com/EVR). My friend [Arlie](https://www.facebook.com/arlie.carstens) told me about this NYC station before I even had Rdio. They dissapeared for a while but [are back](http://www.wired.com/2015/04/internet-radio-soulless-outlaw-station-fix/) on some new independent radio platform called [Dash Radio](http://dashradio.com/).

## Handy Utils

- [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/). The **best** iOS podcast app. Key feature: listen to podcasts on your iPhone and continue listening where you left off on your desktop (and vice versa).
- [Streamkeys](http://www.streamkeys.com/). Excellent Chrome extension to use your keyboard to control music from a wide variety of music platforms.
- [last.fm Scrobbler](https://github.com/david-sabata/web-scrobbler). Another Chrome extension that scrobbles tunes from a huge selection of platforms to [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/).

## Conclusion

I could go on and on, but what it comes down to is that, there's just too much amazing **free music** to lock myself in any paid subscription services.
