Years ago, the web nerds at Sole Technology used to have our own little blog called The Hot Crew. Where we would write about some of the project we did, or other skateboard nonsense.

Started with me, then later when we needed a backend nerd, I /joined #php on EFNet and asked if someone in SoCal wanted to work for a skate and snow company. I pretty much got kicked right away, however some dude msgsed me and was like "yo, which snow company". That was Mike Matz, who at that time was working for the hottest flash company in the world: 2Advanced Studios (anyone remember them?). We pretty much hired him right away.

Later we needed a real designer, Mike some dude that he knew from surfing. That's when Randy Pikul came in and elevated the look of all the sites by tenfold. 
big guido.
He's now some fancy big shot creative director at Apple.

After that we hired another front end nerd, because 

He since moved back to the east coast and recebntly installed a mini ramp on his property. Can confirm that we're all hella jelly off this!

I forgot who came up with the logo, I assume it was Randy, because he designed the whole site, but it was a chair with heat wave radiating from the seat. 


Back then we already came up with a "dark mode". The site would be shown in a dark theme if we were not in the office. Mike Matz wrote some fancy script that would swap out the CSS file to light at 9am, and back to dark after 5pm. 

The site also had a little footer with links to W3C HTML and CSS validators. We were the only companiesweb team within the skate industry that cared about this. And looking at current state of web development in the industry, we still were!

The current CSS validator doesn't work, I'm using TailwindCSS, which uses some fancy utilities, that are breaking the validator, but everything is working. 

I mean Trebuchet MS and Verdana font? Show me a site that uses those now!

Also we used to run the site on WordPress, but this site runs on Eleventy, one of the fastest static site generators.

Not sure how long I will keep this design up, so in case I change things up again, some screenshots of the The Hot Crew theme
