Yesterday I enjoyed a great lunch with [Parra][1], one of the guys behind [Tired Skateboards][2]. While reminiscing about our time skating together, he noted that kids nowadays don’t really understand "skateboard humor" anymore.

The comments on this [tongue-in-cheek article][3] about Nyjah Huston pretty much prove Parra’s theory. Fair to say we old guys miss [Big Brother Magazine][4]?
