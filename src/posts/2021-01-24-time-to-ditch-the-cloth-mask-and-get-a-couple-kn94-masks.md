This [aerosol engineer](https://youtu.be/4JFed_ofCwM?t=65) (and bike nerd) Aaron Collins, has been doing mask research and sharing his findings on YouTube. The videos are pretty lengthy, I watched em all, so here's my incredible dumbed-down synopsis. 

Cloth masks and surgical masks are good at [protecting other people](https://youtu.be/Z93BoeCuIE4?t=165), they only have a 50% filter efficiency, and therefore not very good at protecting yourself. Doubling up on masks only [makes things worse](https://youtu.be/Z93BoeCuIE4?t=312).

What you need is an N95 mask, they not only protect others but also yourself. N95 masks have a 95+% filter efficiency. However, N95's are for first responders only. A great alternative is a KN95 mask, similar filter efficiency as N95, but not US government approved, so quality control may be risky. In comes KF94, a Korean general population standard, and they [perform really well](https://youtu.be/Gu0GkjOpOj0?t=55).

Dive into [the full dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eE2BERAvRzs28kG87ft3a27FS9-gHvdC) to find a mask right for you.

You can wear the mask for [30-40 hours](https://youtu.be/_In-nBP6WkQ?t=105) in a clean office-type environment. After wearing a mask, [let it sit for at least 4 days](https://youtu.be/Gu0GkjOpOj0?t=1187), then you can reuse it again. Pro tip: Buy a couple of masks to keep in rotation.

**Heavy disclaimer: my synopsis is extremely watered down, I advise you to watch all of [Aaron's mask videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/coll0412/videos), this great write-up about [Aaron on Yahoo News](https://huphtur.nl/time-to-ditch-the-cloth-mask-and-get-a-couple-kn94-masks/), and do your research to find the right mask for you.**
