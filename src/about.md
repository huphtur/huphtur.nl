I'm Marcel Appelman, a tall, skinny Dutch guy with a penchant for cycling, skateboarding, and nerdy computer crap. This is my personal web site, anything jotted down here is my humble (and quiet often incorrect) opion. I'm Dutch, not perfect.

Huphtur started as a zine, founded by a couple friends to support the Dutch skateboard scene in the early 90s. It's a misspelling of the word _hufter_ which is old Dutch for: bastard, jackass, asshole (you get the idea). The magazine is [long gone](https://web.archive.org/web/19970225192142/http://www.huphtur.nl/), but I kept the name as a unique identifier on the internet.

You can also find me on a bunch of other online entities such as
[GitHub](https://github.com/huphtur),
[Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/huphtur),
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/huphtur), 
and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/huphtur/).
