title: "About huphtur"
---
I'm Marcel Appelman, a tall, skinny Dutch guy with a penchant for cycling, skateboarding, and nerdy computer crap. This is my personal web site, anything jotted down here is my humble (and quiet often incorrect) opion. _I'm Dutch, not perfect._

Huphtur started as a zine, founded by a couple friends to support the Dutch skateboard scene in the early nineties. _Huphtur_ a misspelling of the word [_hufter_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hufter) which is old Dutch for: bastard, jackass, asshole (you get the idea). The magazine is [long gone](https://web.archive.org/web/19970225192142/http://www.huphtur.nl/), but I kept the name as a unique identifier on the internet.
