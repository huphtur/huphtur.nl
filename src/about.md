👋 I'm Marcel Appelman, a tall, ~~skinny~~ Dutch guy with a penchant for [cycling](/cycling/), [skateboarding](/skateboarding/), [music](/music/), and [nerdy computer stuff](/nerdy-computer-stuff/). 

This is my personal website; anything jotted down here is my humble (and quite often incorrect) opinion. _I'm Dutch, not perfect._

_Huphtur_ is a misspelling of the word [_hufter_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hufter); which is old Dutch for: bastard, jackass, asshole (you get the idea). 

_Huphtur_ started as a zine, founded by a couple of friends to support the Dutch skateboard scene in the early nineties. The magazine is [long gone](https://web.archive.org/web/19970225192142/http://www.huphtur.nl/), but I kept the name as a unique identifier on the internet.
